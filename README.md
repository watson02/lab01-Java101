## Introduction

This assignment requires programmers to set up Docker and this course's Docker image, and then implement and test a Java program, called `AnalyzeText`, that will produce textual output demonstrating a simple analysis of a book. First, the program will display the name of the programmer and the date at which the program was run. Then, it will display the information about the book, such as its title, author, the number of words it has. Finally, the program will allow the user to search for specific keywords in the book. As verified by [Checkstyle](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle), the source code for the `AnalyzeText.java` file must adhere to all of the requirements in the [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

The developer is also responsible for writing a reflection document, written in a Markdown language that adheres to the standards described in the [Markdown Syntax Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and answers the questions outlined in the template reflection document. Remember, you can preview the contents of a committed Markdown file by clicking on the name of the file in your GitHub repository.

When you use the `git commit` command to transfer your source code to your GitHub repository, [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) will initialize a build of your assignment, checking to see if it meets all of the requirements. If both your source code and writing meet the established requirements, then you will see a green ✔ in the listing of commits in GitHub. If your submission does not meet the requirements, a red ✗ will appear instead. The instructor will reduce a programmer's grade for this assignment if the red ✗ appears on the last commit in GitHub immediately before the assignment's due date.

## Learning

If you have not done so already, please read all of the relevant [GitHub Guides](https://guides.github.com/) that explain how to use many of the features that GitHub provides. In particular, please make sure that you have read the following GitHub guides: [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/), and [Documenting Your Projects on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/). Each of these guides will help you to understand how to use both [GitHub](http://github.com) and [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/).

To do well on this assignment, you should also review Chapter 1, 2, and 3 of the course textbook. Please see the course instructor or one of the technical leaders if you have questions about any of these reading assignments.

## Docker Instructions

In this course we will use Docker for an environment where we can compile and execute programs. This provides an environment with the languages that will be used in the class and ensures that everyone uses the same versions for help and grading purposes. If you do not have Docker set up from a previous class, please do so first.

- [Docker Mac Setup](https:/docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
- [Docker Ubuntu Setup](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04)
- [Docker Windows Setup](https:/docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)

If the setup goes correctly as desired, you should be able to get started and validate the Docker version and run the hello world docker container using the following commands:

```
docker --version
docker run hello-world
```

### progator Docker Image

Follow the instructions below, which can also be found at the `progator` Docker image link provided below, to get started. Additionally, please watch the lab introduction video for a working example of how to access the Docker image for this course and how to mount a directory as a volume.

[progator Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/janyljumadinova/progator)

#### Pulling Image

Download automated build from public Docker Hub Registry:

`docker pull janyljumadinova/progator`

#### Running

You can mount a directory as a volume with the argument *-v /your-path/directory/:/root/ like this :

`docker run -d -p 80:80 -v /your-path/local/working/directory/:/root/environment janyljumadinova/progator`

Otherwise, you can start a Docker container without connecting your directory as shown below but you will not be able to access your lab files from within Docker:

`docker run -d -p 80:80 janyljumadinova/progator`

#### Accessing the IDE

<http://localhost>

#### Working in the Localhost Window

Once you have localhost open in your browser, all other instructions will be completed in that window. If you close the window, just go to localhost again - you will not lose anything.

When you open localhost, you will see:

![local host window](InstructionImages/Image1.png?raw=true)

On the left side, click on the Explorer icon (2nd down). Click Open Folder and enter "/root/" ![](InstructionImages/Image2.png?raw=true)

In the Explorer frame, right click, and click on Open in Integrated Terminal. ![](InstructionImages/Image3.png?raw=true)

You now have a terminal in which you can run most typical Linux commands. Ubuntu 20.04 is running with VSCode. Most work will be completed in the terminal. You are encouraged to mount a directory as a volume as described in the documentation at [progator Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/janyljumadinova/progator) so that you can have access to your local repository files, which can be accessed from the "environment" directory in "root".

Please remember to stop the container after you are finished working in it. You can use the command: `docker container list` to see the ID of the running container, and `docker container stop container-ID` to stop the container by replacing `container-ID` with its actual ID.

#### Running and Testing Java Program

To compile the Java program, run: `javac AnalyzeText.java` in the terminal.

Observe that `AnalyzeText.class` file is now created. To execute the Java program, run the following command: `java AnalyzeText`

## Program Instructions

This lab invites programmers to implement a Java program that analyzes a large body of text automatically. First, your program will calculate and output some statistics about the book, specifically the title, author, year information if available, and the number of words in a book of your choosing. Then, you will implement a searching functionality for the user to look up specific information and the number of its occurrences in the book. To get started, download a book or two--I have added a few books into the lab repository's /input directory, or you can visit [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/) and pick some other classics. Then write a Java program that prints out information about the book, calculates the number of words in the book, and allows the user to search to book based on specified keywords as described below.

### Displaying Information About a Book

Once you have chosen the book you would like to analyze, change the `fileName` variable's assignment to point to your chosen book. Then, open the text file of your book and check where preamble information regarding the title, author, etc. is located; make a note of the number of lines this information occupies at the beginning of the document. Then, modify the value assigned to the `preambleLines` variable according to this number of lines to ensure you display all relevant information. Finally, using a `while` loop, read and print these first few lines of the document.

### Calculating the Number of Words in a Book

We all know that books can have lots of words. For instance, "War and Peace" has somewhere between 560,000 and 580,000 words, depending on the translation. But how can you automatically count the number of words in a book? During this lab you will develop a solution to this question.

First, the program needs to read the file until the end of the file. There are several ways to read words from a text file. One way to do this is to use a `try/catch` block and a `File` and a `Scanner` to read a file. Then, as you are reading each word from the file you should count it. Please omit the preamble with the title, author, year and other information. You should only count the words in the text of the book directly.

**Can we do better?** Yes, we can do better--for instance, punctuation such as quotation marks, periods, commas, etc., will be read in as part of some of the words. That means that things like "however," and "however." will be treated as two distinct words. Can you eliminate this problem? Here are a couple of possible approaches:

1. Use `String` class's replace method to replace all commas and periods with space.
2. The `Character` class, which is the wrapper class for `char`, has a `boolean` method named `isLetter`; you might use it like this:

  ```
  ...
  char c = w.charAt(i);  // get the i-th character of w
  if (Character.isLetter(c)) { // see if c is a letter
  ... do something
  }
  ```

### Searching Functionality

Now, you can implement a searching functionality to allow the user to search the text for two keywords and display lines of text with those keywords along with the count of occurrences of those keywords. Use the class program called SearchText as an inspiration for this algorithm. Please note that you will have to re-initialize the `Scanner` object if using the same Scanner variable from the previous step, since in the previous step the Scanner has read through the whole document and is now at the end of the file, so we need to make it start from the beginning of the document again. Otherwise, you can create a brand new Scanner variable.

## Program Requirements

You should design and implement a Java program that does the following.

1. Display the preamble information about the book, including the book's title and the author.
2. Count the number of words (excluding punctuation) in the book and display this information to the terminal.
3. Read in two keywords from the user to utilize in the search and save them into two String variables.
4. Count the number of occurrences of the user's keywords in the book and display the text lines containing them.
5. Print an exit message.

The source code in the `AnalyzeText.java` file must also pass additional tests set by the [GatorGrader tool](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrade). GatorGrader will check the following characteristics of your implementation:

- The `AnalyzeText` program must:

  - Contain at least 10 single-line comments and 2 multi-line comments
  - Include at least 8 `println` statements
  - Use `new Scanner`, `new File`, `FileNotFoundException` commands.
  - Declare at least two `int` variables.
  - Utilize conditional `if` once and repetition `while` statements twice.
  - Use at least one boolean OR expression.
  - Perform and display textual analysis of the book as outlined above.

The following gives a sample run of a previously implemented version of the program. Your output should be different! Please see the course instructor if you do not understand this program's output.
